The data cleaning process was formally conducted to refine and prepare the raw Netflix dataset for analytical purposes. Initially, duplicate records were identified and removed to maintain accuracy and prevent redundancy within the dataset. Missing values were then addressed by substituting them with the term “Unknown,” ensuring that all fields remained complete and consistent. Furthermore, text-based columns such as title, director, cast, and country were standardized by removing unnecessary spaces and applying proper case formatting to enhance uniformity and readability.
Through these systematic and formal cleaning procedures, the dataset was successfully transformed into a well-structured and reliable format. The final cleaned file, netflix cleaned data, is now prepared for further stages of data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning model development.
